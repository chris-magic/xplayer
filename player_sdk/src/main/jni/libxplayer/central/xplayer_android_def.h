// Generic error codes for the media player framework.  Errors are fatal, the
// playback must abort.
//
// Errors are communicated back to the client using the
// MediaPlayerListener::notify method defined below.
// In this situation, 'notify' is invoked with the following:
//   'msg' is set to MEDIA_ERROR.
//   'ext1' should be a value from the enum media_error_type.
//   'ext2' contains an implementation dependant error code to provide
//          more details. Should default to 0 when not used.
//
// The codes are distributed as follow:
//   0xx: Reserved
//   1xx: Android Player errors. Something went wrong inside the MediaPlayer.
//   2xx: Media errors (e.g Codec not supported). There is a problem with the
//        media itself.
//   3xx: Runtime errors. Some extraordinary condition arose making the playback
//        impossible.
