video player have the following state machine:
    demux state machine ,
    audio decoder state machine,
    video decoder state machine ,


Each State Machine has its own state .

Such as Video Decoder State Machine has state :
            STATE_DECODER_START,
            STATE_DECODER_WAIT,
            STATE_DECODER_DECODING.

  Demux State Machine Rename to Central Engine State Machine .
    change media demux work be put into Central Engine State Machine Thread

 First Decode will happen until is_pkt_q_full(mediaFileHandle->start_playing_buffering_time) be performed.
 So before that ,you should not call decode function.

    任何一个 OpenSL ES 的对象，创建成功后，都进入 SL_OBJECT_STATE_UNREALIZED 状态，这种状态下，系统不会为它分配任何资源，直到调用 Realize 函数为止。
    Realize 后的对象，就会进入 SL_OBJECT_STATE_REALIZED 状态，这是一种“可用”的状态，只有在这种状态下，对象的各个功能和资源才能正常地访问。

    OpenSL ES major operations is interfaces ,such as: SLObjectItf ---Itf = Interface.
